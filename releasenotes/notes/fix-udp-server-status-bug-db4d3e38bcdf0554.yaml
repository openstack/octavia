    When a load balancer with a UDP listener is updated, the listener service
    is restarted, which causes an interruption of the flow of traffic during a
    short period of time. This issue is caused by a keepalived bug
    (https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1163) that was fixed in
    keepalived 2.0.14, but this package is not yet provided by distributions.
fixes:

    Fix a bug that prevented UDP servers to be restored as members of a pool
    after removing a health monitor resource.
