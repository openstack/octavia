    Now the following options accept values which are actually supported, and
    usage of an unsupported value may cause octavia services to fail to start.
    Previously unsupported values were accepted and caused failures in actual
    resource creation.

    - ``[api_settings] default_listener_tls_versions``
    - ``[api_settings] default_pool_tls_versions``
    - ``[api_settings] default_listener_alpn_protocols``
    - ``[api_settings] default_pool_alpn_protocols``

    See ``octavia.conf`` file generated by the ``oslo-config-generator`` tool
    to find supported values.
