    Removed unused amphora-related code including the get_create_amphora_flow
    function, MarkAmphoraReadyInDB task class, MARK_AMPHORA_READY_INDB
    constant, and AMPHORA_READY status constant. Updated amphora deletion
    logic to only allow deletion when amphora status is ERROR, which is the
    correct behavior since AMPHORA_ALLOCATED amphorae should not be deletable.
