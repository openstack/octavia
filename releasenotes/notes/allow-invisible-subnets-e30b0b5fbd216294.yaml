upgrade:
  - |
    After this upgrade, users will no longer be able use network resources they
    cannot see or "show" on load balancers. Operators can revert this behavior
    by setting the "allow_invisible_reourece_usage" configuration file setting
    to ``True``.
security:
  - |
    Previously, if a user knew or could guess the UUID for a network resource,
    they could use that UUID to create load balancer resources using that UUID.
    Now the user must have permission to see or "show" the resource before it
    can be used with a load balancer. This will be the new default, but
    operators can disable this behavior via the setting the configuration file
    setting "allow_invisible_resource_usage" to ``True``. This issue falls
    under the "Class C1" security issue as the user would require a valid UUID.
