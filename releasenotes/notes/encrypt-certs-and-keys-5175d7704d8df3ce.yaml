    As a followup to the fix that resolved CVE-2018-16856, Octavia will now
    encrypt certificates and keys used for secure communication with amphorae,
    in its internal workflows. Octavia used to exclude debug-level log prints
    for specific tasks and flows that were explicitly specified by name, a
    method that is susceptive to code changes.

    Added a new option named server_certs_key_passphrase under the certificates
    section. The default value gets copied from an environment variable named
    TLS_PASS_AMPS_DEFAULT. In a case where TLS_PASS_AMPS_DEFAULT is not set,
    and the operator did not fill any other value directly,
    'insecure-key-do-not-use-this-key' will be used.
