    The Octavia v2 API now supports Role Based Access Control (RBAC).
    The default rules require users to have a load-balancer_* role to be
    able to access the Octavia v2 API.  This can be overriden with the
    admin_or_owner-policy.json sample file provided.
    See the `Octavia Policies
    <https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/latest/configuration/policy.html>`_
    document for more information.

    Note that while the Octavia v2 API now supports Role Bassed Access
    Control (RBAC), the Octavia v1.0 API does not.  The Octavia v1.0 API
    should not be exposed publicly and should only be used internally
    such as for the neutron-lbaas octavia driver.  Publicly accessible
    instances of the Octavia API should have the v1.0 API disabled via the
    Octavia configuration file.
