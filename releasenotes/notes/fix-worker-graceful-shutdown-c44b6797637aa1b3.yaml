    Fix a bug that could interrupt resource creation when performing a graceful
    shutdown of the controller worker and leave resources in a
    PENDING_CREATE/PENDING_UPDATE/PENDING_DELETE provisioning status. If the
    duration of an Octavia flow is greater than the 'graceful_shutdown_timeout'
    configuration value, stopping the Octavia worker can still interrupt the
    creation of resources.
