    In some enviornments (e.g. OSA) Neutron and Octavia use different queues
    (at least different vhosts) and so if Octavia posts to the Octavia queue
    and Neutron listens on the Neutron queue the events will never make it
    over.

    This adds a way to configure a custom queue for the event streamer thus
    allowing to post messages to the Neutron queue if needed.

    Depending on how the other queue is set up additional passwords for the
    other queue will be in the Octavia config file. Operators should take care
    of setting up appropriate users with appropriate restrictions to the
    topic(s) needed.
